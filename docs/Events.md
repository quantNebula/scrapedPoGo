## Data Structure

The events file is organized by **eventType** at the top level, with each event type containing an array of events:

```json
{
  "community-day": [ {...}, {...} ],
  "raid-battles": [ {...}, {...} ],
  "season": [ {...} ],
  "event": [ {...}, {...}, {...} ],
  ...
}
```

This structure allows applications to:
- Load only specific event types they need: `events["community-day"]`
- Reduce payload size by filtering event types
- Logically segment data by event category

## Accessing Specific Event Types

Each `eventType` also has its own dedicated endpoint containing only events of that type. These files mirror the event objects in `events.min.json`, but are filtered to a single `eventType`. They are automatically generated by `combinedetails.js`.

**Use cases:**
- When you only need one type of event (e.g., only community days)
- To reduce bandwidth and payload size
- For backwards compatibility with older integrations

**Endpoint pattern:**
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/quantNebula/scrapedPoGo@main/data/eventTypes/<eventType>.min.json
```

See the [Event Type Specific Endpoints](#event-type-specific-endpoints) table above for a complete list of available endpoints.

## Example Event Object

Events are now **logically segmented** with a `details` wrapper containing all structured content. Flags are computed based on actual data presence:

If you want to figure out what type of event a specific event on [LeekDuck.com/events](https://www.leekduck.com/events/) is, use your browser's dev tools to determine what class is setting the background color of that event. The class name is the same as the event type (except for `pokemon-go-fest` and `pokemon-spotlight-hour`, where the accented "é" is replaced with "e").

## Note for Start/End dates

The `start` and `end` fields are DateTime objects encoded in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

Most events in Pokemon GO occur based around a user's local timezone. However, there are also some events that happen at the same time globally.

If an event starts/ends at the same time globally, the `start` and `end` fields will have strings ending with "Z", signifying the DateTime is in UTC. Otherwise, the DateTime displayed is based on the user's local timezone.

### Event Type Date Formats

| Event Type | Format | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Community Day | Local | `2022-06-01T14:00:00.000` - occurs 2-5pm local |
| Spotlight Hour | Local | `2022-06-01T18:00:00.000` - occurs 6-7pm local |
| Raid Hour | Local | `2022-06-01T18:00:00.000` - occurs 6-7pm local |
| GO Battle League | UTC | `2022-06-01T21:00:00.000Z` - same moment worldwide |
| Pokémon GO Tour (city) | UTC | `2022-02-20T17:00:00.000Z` - specific city timezone |
| Pokémon GO Tour (global) | Local | `2022-02-28T10:00:00.000` - 10am-6pm local |

### Implementation Details

LeekDuck's raw feed may include timezone offsets (e.g., `2022-06-01T13:00:00.000-0800`). These are automatically normalized during scraping:

- **Local times** (24 chars): Preserved as-is
- **Timezone offsets** (>24 chars): Converted to UTC with "Z" suffix
- **UTC times** (ending with Z): Preserved as-is

See `normalizeDate()` in `src/utils/scraperUtils.js` for the implementation.

Depending on the use case, many parsers (ex: Javascript's `Date.parse()`) will handle this automatically.

## Event Type Specific Fields

Events are organized into **logical sections** based on their content. The following sections may appear based on event type:
