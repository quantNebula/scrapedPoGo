## 2026-01-31 - Shiny Data Shape Mismatch
**Learning:** `data/shinies.min.json` is an array in this repo (not `{ shinies: [...] }`), but `loadShinyData()` only reads `data.shinies` so the cross-reference Map is empty (`size === 0`). This means any “shiny cross-reference” work is currently a no-op, and optimizations like memoizing `loadShinyData()` only save the read+parse cost (cache hit was ~0.001ms vs ~2.6ms cold in a local check) but don’t improve correctness.  
**Action:** Next time shiny correctness/perf matters, make `loadShinyData()` accept both shapes (array and `{ shinies: [...] }`) while keeping the memoization so multi-scraper runs don’t re-read/re-parse the same file.
